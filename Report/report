Project: Predicting Electrical Bill  

 

✅ Data Loading & Cleaning 

Loaded Electricity Bill Dataset dataset. 

Deleted rows where motor pump column = 0 since these do not contribute to power consumption and would not affect the result, ensuring data relevance. 

Ensured consistent data types for all numerical columns for accurate scaling and modeling. 

Applied pd.get_dummies on city and company columns to convert categorical variables into numerical form, enabling the regression model to utilize these features effectively. 

✅ Data Visualization 

Explored trends between monthly hours, tariff rate, motor HP, and electrical bill. 

Plotted scatter plots, heatmaps, and pairplots to check correlations. 

✅ Feature Engineering 

Created two versions of the model: 

Full model: Includes monthly hours and tariff rate. 

Reduced model: Excludes monthly hours and tariff rate to test dependency on operational features. 

✅ Preprocessing 

Used train-test split (80-20) for validation. 

Applied StandardScaler to normalize feature ranges. 

✅ Model Building 

Implemented Linear Regression for prediction. 

Evaluated using: 

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for error magnitude. 

R² Score for variance explanation. 

✅ Results Interpretation 

Compared R² and RMSE between full and reduced models to analyze the impact of excluded features. 

Identified the contribution of monthly hours and tariff rate on bill predictability. 

✅ Streamlit App Deployment 

Built an interactive Streamlit app: 

Option to select: 

Full model (with hours, tariff) or 

Reduced model (without them). 

Users can input values (motor HP, monthly hours, tariff, etc.) to predict the “Electrical Bill” live. 

Displays predicted bill amount, RMSE, and R² of the selected model for transparency. 

✅ Model Evaluation Results: 

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0 (My model’s predictions exactly match the actual electricity bills in your dataset with zero error) 

R² Score: 1 (Your model perfectly explains 100% of the variance in the electricity bill using Usage_Tariff_Interaction.) 

Usage_Tariff_Interaction = Monthly_hours * Tariff_rate 

✅ Feature Importance Evaluation : 

By comparing the model performance with and without monthly hours and tariff rate, I found: 

Models including monthly hours and tariff rate had significantly higher R² scores and lower RMSE, indicating better predictive power. 

Removing these features reduced the model’s ability to explain variance in the “Electrical Bill”, confirming that: 

Monthly operational hours (usage patterns) and 

Tariff rate (cost per unit electricity) 
 are critical factors influencing the electrical bill for motor pumps. 

Extras:
